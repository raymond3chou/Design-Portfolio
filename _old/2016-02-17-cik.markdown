CIK Telecom is the largest Internet and TV service provider in Canada among the Chinese-Canadian community. In 2015, CIK launched lehuo.ca, a website and mobile app providing great deals and promotions from businesses across Toronto. As an intern, I was responsible for creating ads and coupons, as well as branding material such as logos for many of these businesses. I also contributed to redesigns of the website and the mobile application.
