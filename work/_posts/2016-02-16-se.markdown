Science Expo is the largest student-run organization in Canada, connecting youth to the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) community. Since sumer 2014, I have been working with them as the site developer and graphic designer. 

<br><br>In July 2015, I redesigned and built the main website (over the course of one weekend): <a href="http://science-expo.org/" target="_blank"> science-expo.org </a>.

One of my major tasks last year was creating all of the promotional graphics for our annual flagship conference. Last year's conference was named Synapse.

print_hi('Tom')
