Homeline Bling is a hotline homeless people can call using a street payphone, and the hotline will relay the name and location of the closest shelter near the caller. So for those late, cold nights, Homeline Bling will provide you with a home. 

<br><br>
I worked on designing and implementing the accompanying web application using Bootstrap, Google Maps API, and built on the Django framework. I also helped with deploying the website on Azure and setting up Twilio capabilities.
