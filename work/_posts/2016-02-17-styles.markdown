ZED Styles is a new proposed small business, providing clients with detailed, and customizable zipper accessories. ZED Styles' first product is ZED Pops, a zipper clip with customized graphics that covers the existing zipper tag. For the project, a business proposal was written, a prototype of the product was created, and mockups of the branding and website were designed.
