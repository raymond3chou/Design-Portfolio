The Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) is the ....
<br><br>For the past 2 years, I have been part of the core Officer team, organizing our various activities, but also in charge of our website and online presence. In the Summer of 2017, I completely redesigned and relaunched our outdated <a href="cfes.ca" target="_blank">website</a> on Wordpress, with a custom theme developed using the Gantry Framework. I have also designed dozens of different graphics and branding material for both our internal documents and social media outreach, including a brand guildline for the organization.

<br><br>Through the CFES, I've had the opportunity to strengthen my leadership skills by representing and networking with engineering students from across Canada.
