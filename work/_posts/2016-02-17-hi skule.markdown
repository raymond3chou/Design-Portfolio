Hi-Skule is an organization at the University of Toronto organized by undergraduate engineering students, with the goal of introducing the discipline of engineering to high school students. I was tasked with update the Hi-Skule branding, and the result is a cleaner and much more modern design, with a minimalistic hard-hat icon and bold typography.
