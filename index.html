                <h4>APS111</h4>
                <p>
                    My first experience with engineering design was in the first-year engineering strategies and
                    practices (ESP I) course, where we had to design an engineering solution to transport vaccines in an
                    environment that was not hospitable to it. In groups of 5, we identified the
                    primary functions, objectives, and constraints of the design problem. Using what we had learned in
                    class, we attempted to generate innovative ideas through the help of structured brainstorming. After
                    coming up with 5 alternative designs, we selected the most optimal design for the problem by
                    utilizing a weighted decision matrix. From the results we gained, we found that cryo-pack design was
                    the best design due to its ability to meet the functions and constraints, while performing the best
                    on our objectives. This design taught me how to scope and identify the gap within a client's problem
                    statement.

                <h4>APS112</h4>
                <p>
                    In ESPII, I got a chance to apply my learning in solving a problem for a client. Our team was
                    tasked to design a way to teach high school students about engineering design through a fun
                    activity. Again, we leveraged our learnings from class and identified the problem's functions,
                    objectives, and constraints to identify the gap we needed to fill. Next, we used a pairwise
                    comparison chart
                    to determine the best design out of the dozens of designs we brainstormed. The
                    design we came up with was called the “Angry Birds™ Catapult Design” (ABCD). ABCD was a fun design
                    where participants were challenged to create catapults (Angry Bird™ stations) and use
                    measurements/calculations to aim and fire a projectile at a designated target. It incorporated
                    topics from five courses: Dynamics, Mechanics, Applied Science and Materials; and Engineering
                    Strategies and Practice I & II. From this experience, I learned the value of teamwork and
                    brainstorming
                    in helping develop innovative solutions. </p>

                <p>
                    In second year, my object-oriented programming course helped me develop my programming and
                    engineering design skills.
                    During the course we were tasked with developing a program that would match students and
                    schools together using the Gale Shapley algorithm. The process of building this java program from
                    scratch, taught me the importance of planning and documenting my design process. Moreover, the
                    project also taught me that in order to build a functional and scalable product, it should be built
                    in
                    parts and modularly such that each section can be tested and debugged.

                <h4>MIE240</h4>
                <p>
                    Another course in my second year that affected my view on engineering design was the human-centered
                    design course. This course made me realize the importance of designing for people. I learned
                    that designing for people required a lot of iterative testing as well as heuristic design.
                    Essentially,
                    it is necessary to use heuristics to save time and test them quickly using low-fidelity prototypes.
                    Additionally in the course, I worked
                    on a project to improve the user-interface of Spotify's desktop application. In a team of 3, we
                    leveraged our course knowledge to reduce the number errors in the task of adding a song into your
                    playlist, while also increasing the learnability of the application by changing button locations and
                    increasing feedback.

                    The course that helped me develop the most relevant technical skills to solve my capstone problem,
                    was Analytics in Action. This course
                    focused on the theory and application of machine learning and data science. In a team of 4, we
                    developed a machine learning binary classification model that would
                    predict whether a song would enter the billboard 100 based on its musical characteristics only. The
                    experience of working with class imbalance and a high-dimensional feature space was
                    essential to our capstone design as we should encounter these issues again.

                        <p>
                            Outside of my coursework, I seeked out oppurtunities to solve real world problems. During
                            the summer after third year,
                            I had the honour of attending the annual NBA hackathon where I predicted an
                            “exciting” run so that NBA teams can anticipate potential onslaught before it occurs. In a
                            team, I created an ensemble model to predict the
                            occurrence of "exciting" runs during an NBA game. This experience helped me understand how
                            to present technical solutions to a wide audience, which will ultimately serve useful when
                            working with eBay Canada for Capstone. Moreover, this project developed me as an industrial
                            engineering student by improving my data science and statistical analysis skills.

                        <p>
                            Using my knowledge of machine learning from MIE465 as well as human-centered design from
                            MIE240, I developed a solution that aims to address the lack of support for the visually
                            impaired by harnessing a Microsoft Cognitive API to provide real-time information on facial
                            expressions during a video call. Through this experience, I learned that engineers need to
                            consider a wide variety of different factors such as user environment, usability,
                            functionality when designing a product.

                            In a team of 4, I helped hack a Roomba, an automous vacumm, to play sheet music and dance.
                            This experience taught me how to work with other students from different engineering
                            disciplines. We leveraged our strengths to create something completely novel and unique
                            while developing a business case for the solution. This experience would help me in planning

                            During my 12-month PEY at eBay Canada, I helped run weekly cadences of the business as well
                            as helped develop new processes for marketing campaigns and public relations pitches.
                            Moreover, I determined a methodology to measure the impact of eBay Canada’s new Brand
                            campaign. I
                            was able to identify an overall incremental revenue and incremental traffic for out-of-home
                            billboard and TTC ads. This experience provided me with both the soft and technical skills
                            necessary to be a productive engineer. As well as hands-on experience solving real world
                            problems that impacted a company’s short- and long-term business. Unfortunately, I cannot
                            share the work I completed during my time as it is the intellectual property of eBay Inc.

                        <p>
                            During my summer with BMO Capital Markets, I developed and launched production platform
                            for live futures and option risk tracking using React and proprietary framework; the
                            platform
                            simplified the reoccurring futures pricing process as well as the book risk evaluation. This
                            experience
                            taught me that in order to be successful engineer, it is necessary to perform constant
                            due diligence on my own work, especially when money is on the line. Through this internship,
                            I realised that my passion was in developing engineering solution in the Financial industry.
                            Unfortunately, I cannot share the work I completed during my time as it is the intellectual
                            property of BMO Financial Group.

            <h4>Improving Buyer Reactivation with Predictive Coupon Targeting</h4>
            <p>
                For my graduate capstone, I had the privilege of working with eBay Canada to look for way to growth
                their active buyer base. This project was the culmination my 4 prior years of engineering design and
                study. I served as the primary data scientist and helped analyse data as well as build and test our
                classification model. My experiences from MIE465 helped me identify and solve the issue of class
                imbalance, while my learnings from the NBA hackathon and PEY at eBay Canada guided me through the dense
                eBay data warehouse. Moreover, the due diligence I picked up from my time at BMO helped me look for
                better solutions while constantly iterating our design solution. Finally, the knowledge from ESP I and
                ESP II helped me
                identify the functions, objectives, and constraints necessary to scope down the problem. The combination
                of all my gained knowledge, skills, and experiences resulted in an engineering product that could be
                used by eBay Canada in optimizing their marketing campaigns, saving their costs along the way. This
                achievement could not have been possible without my 3 other capstone members who dedicated their time
                and engineering talent to this project. Moreover, the feedback I received from the TELS survey helped
                structure my self improvement both as an engineer and as a team mate. Unfortunately, the project is
                under NDA so I am only able to
                share our design showcase poster.

                <p>
                    After graduation, I hope to utilize the knowledge, experiences, and engineering design skills I
                    obtained throughout the course of my undergraduate degree to solve real-world problems. I will
                    continuously improve my approach to engineering design as well as expand my knowledge. Moreover, I
                    will take my teammates advice through the TELS survey to identify and work on my weaknesses. I hope
                    that
                    my experiences at the University of Toronto will serve as constant reminder that, as an engineer, I work
                    to serve other people and society.
