I will demonstrate how I learned and applied engineering design through coursework projects as well as extracurricular engagements. Finally, I will go over how the skills I have learned and engineering design projects I have worked on, helped in addressing eBay Canada’s active buyer problem during my fourth-year multi-disciplinary capstone project.

                <h4>APS111</h4>
                <p>
                    My first experience with engineering design was in the first-year engineering strategies and practices  (ESP) course where we had to design an engineering solution to transport vaccines in an environment that was not hospitable to it. In a group of 5 other engineers, we identified the primary functions, objectives, and constraints of the design problem. Using what we had learned in class, we attempted to generate innovative ideas through the help of structured brainstorming.  After coming up with 5 alternative designs, we selected the most optimal design for the problem by utilizing a weighted decision matrix. From the results we gained, we found that cryo-pack design was the best design due to its ability to meet the functions and constraints, while performing the best on our objectives.  This design that I helped create using the principles of engineering design.                 </p>

                <p>
                    In ESPII, I got a chance to apply my learning in solving a problem for a client. Our design was tasked to design a way to teach high school students about engineering design through a fun activity. Again, we leveraged our learnings from class and identified the problem functions, objectives, and constraints to scope the problem. Additionally, we used a pairwise comparison chart to determine the best design out of the dozens of designs we brainstormed as shown in Figure 3. The design we came up with was called the “Angry Birds™ Catapult Design” (ABCD). ABCD was a fun design where participants were challenged to create catapults (Angry Bird™ stations) and use measurements/calculations to aim and fire a projectile at a designated target. It incorporated topics from five courses: Dynamics, Mechanics, Applied Science and Materials; and Engineering Strategies and Practice I & II.                </p>

                <h4>MIE250</h4>
                <p>
                    In second year, the object-oriented programming course helped me develop by planning and programming skills. During the course we were tasked with developing a program that would match students and schools together using the Gale Shapley algorithm. The process of building this java program from scratch, taught me the importance of planning and documenting my design process. Moreover, the project also taught me that in order to build a functional and scalable product, it must be built in parts and modularly.

                <p>
                    Another course in my second year that affected my view on engineering design was the human centered design course. This course made me realize the importance of designing for people. I also learned that designing for people required a lot of usability testing and design with a purpose driven by principles that had been researched and tested by researchers in the Human Factors field. I worked on a project to improve the user-interface of the Spotify desktop application. In a tea of 3, we leveraged our course knowledge to reduce the number errors in the task of adding a song into your playlist, while also increasing the learnability of the application by changing button location and feedback.

                <p>
                    The course that helped me develop the necessary technical skills to solve the problem provided to us by eBay Canada was Analytics in Action during the second semester of my third year. This course focused on the theory and application of machine learning and data science. A team of 4 industrial engineers, used our learnings to develop a machine learning binary classification model that would predict whether a song would enter the billboard 100 based on its musical characteristics only. The experience working with class imbalance and high-dimensional feature space in this project was essential to our capstone design as they shared many similarities.

                            Outside of coursework, I worked to solve real world problems such as predicting an “exciting” run so that NBA teams can anticipate potential onslaught before it occurs. A team of 3 industrial engineers including myself, created an ensemble model to predict the occurrence of "exciting" runs during an NBA game. This experience helped me understand how to present technical solutions to a wide audience, which will ultimately serve useful when working with eBay Canada for Capstone. Moreover, this project developed me as an industrial engineering student by improving my data science and statistical analysis skills.

                            During my 12-month PEY at eBay Canada, I helped run weekly cadences on the business as well as helped develop new processes for marketing campaigns and public relations pitches. Moreover, I determined methodology to measure impact of eBay Canada’s new Brand campaign. I was able to identify an overall incremental revenue and incremental traffic for out-of-home billboard and TTC ads. This experience provided me with both the soft and technical skills necessary to be a productive engineer. As well as hands-on experience solving real world problems that impacted the company’s short- and long-term business. Unfortunately, I cannot share the work I completed during my time as it is the intellectual property of eBay Inc.

            <h4>Improving Buyer Reactivation with Predictive Coupon Targeting</h4>
            <p>
                For my graduate capstone, I had the privilege of working with eBay Canada looking for way to growth their active buyer base. This project was the culmination my 4 prior years of engineering design and training. I served as the primary data scientist both analysing data as well as building and testing the classification model. My experiences from MIE465 helped me identify and solve the issue of class imbalance, while my learnings from the NBA hackathon and PEY at eBay Canada guided me through the dense eBay data warehouse. Moreover, the due diligence I picked up from my time at BMO helped me look for better solutions while constantly iterating. Finally, the knowledge from ESP I and ESP II helped me identify the functions, objectives, and constraints necessary to scope down the problem. The combination of all my gained knowledge, skills, and experiences resulted in an engineering product that could be used by eBay Canada in optimizing their marketing campaigns, saving their costs along the way. This achievement could not have been possible without my 3 other capstone members who dedicated their time and engineering talent to this project. Unfortunately, the project is under NDA so I am only able to share our design showcase poster.
