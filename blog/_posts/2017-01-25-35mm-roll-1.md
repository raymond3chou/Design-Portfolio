This past week, I finally developed my first roll of 35mm film. 

I recently discovered the photo lab we have on campus. There, I was shown the process of developing C-41 color negative film by a member of the Photo Lab. Below are some results from the roll.

The roll I shot was Fujifilm ISO 400 on my grandpa's Mamiya ZE Quartz. It was certainly a time-consuming process, but weirdly tranquilizing. It has made me further appreciate the art of analog photography, and personally, I think it made the photos even better.

I think what I love about film photography is rediscovering a memory captured months prior and reliving the moment. The above photo was of my roommate Monika, taken almost 3 months ago with her adorable hamster Pepper <3
