From September to December 2016, I worked as a Rapid Prototyping co-op student at the Canon Innovation Lab, located in Kitchener, Waterloo. It has been one of the best learning opportunities and all-around experiences in my life so far.

The Canon Innovation Lab is a small devision of Canon North America that focuses on agile solutions to potential customer needs. The team, consisting of around a dozen full-time employees and two co-op students each term, is split further into two divisions: the prototyping team, and production team. I was hired as one of the two co-op students, along with a Mechatronics Engineering student one class above me, to work on the prototyping team.
